## Digital Economy and Social Media Trends
### History of Social Media
#### The evolution of social media
Social media is defined as any website or application that enables users to create and share content or to participate in social networking. Approximately two-thirds of all internet users utilize social media. The largest social media user base is in Asia, and the highest penetration rate is in the Middle East. Social media is highly compatible with mobile devices; for instance, 95 percent of Facebook traffic is generated from mobile devices.

### Most Popular Social Media Platforms in 2022
Social media serves as a personal discovery engine. People establish their social media networks to maintain connections with loved ones, stay informed about matters they care about, and be inspired to lead their best lives. It is a carefully thought-out, curated, and personalized network where irrelevant or valueless content is promptly discarded.

The philosophy is to forge meaningful, one-to-one connections between a brand and individuals. This is achieved by leveraging user behaviors to add tangible value to their network, transforming a potentially intrusive marketing tactic into a meaningful experience.

#### Types of social media
- **Social networks**: Encourage both online and offline interaction, such as meetup.com and dating sites.
- **Blogs and micro-blogging**: Can be utilized for demonstrating thought leadership or sharing content, like Twitter.
- **Media sharing**: Platforms such as YouTube or Flickr.
- **Professional networking**: For example, LinkedIn.
- **Reviews and rating sites**.
- **Forums**: Such as Netmums. Forums offer businesses an opportunity to directly engage with customers, but one must be cautious about overt advertising. They can also be an effective way to gauge public opinions about products or brands.
- **The sharing economy**: Examples include Airbnb and Uber.

#### The social networks

- **Instagram**: Boasts 1.21 billion users. One-third of the most viewed stories are from businesses. It focuses on visual and image sharing and can be linked to physical brands, such as posting photos from events. Stories can be created for live updates, and links cannot be added to regular posts.
- **YouTube**: With 2.6 billion users, it is one of the world's largest video platforms. Owned by Google, it is popular for vlogs, reviews, and instructional videos. Live video is an important feature, similar to that on Facebook and other channels.
- **Sina Weibo**: A micro-blogging site specific to China (with a 2,000-character limit per post). Despite relying on sponsorship, it has been very successful. It offers sponsored posts and highly targeted advertising and has 573 million users.
- **TikTok**: The target audience ranges from 13 to 40 years of age. It serves as a great form of entertainment. As a video-based platform, it offers a wide variety of sounds and song snippets. It is very user-friendly, making it easier to edit and upload content, and it has 1 billion users.

## The Rise of the Sharing Economy
The sharing economy is an economic model where goods and resources are collaboratively shared by individuals and groups, turning physical assets into services. Its growth is driven by big data and online platforms. Since 2010, over $23 billion in venture capital has been invested in share - based start - ups, but the exact size of the sharing economy is hard to determine as many relevant firms are private.

The sharing economy has a significant impact on various sectors:

- **Transportation**: Uber's success in the transport sector shows the sharing economy's disruption. By using an efficient mobile app and a network of verified drivers, Uber offers a cost - effective, comfortable, and safe alternative to traditional transit like public transport or taxis.
- **Consumer Goods**: In consumer goods, the key factors in purchasing decisions are convenience, affordability, and efficiency. Sharing - based brands like eBay, which allows users to buy and sell new or used products directly to their homes, dominate. It provides consumers with a more convenient, affordable, and efficient way to shop.
- **Personal and Professional Services**: In technical and personal services, the sharing economy is often manifested as freelance work. These services require skills, knowledge, experience, and certifications, and the sharing economy offers more flexible work arrangements.
- **Healthcare**: Although not fully developed yet, the sharing economy is expected to transform healthcare. Conventional healthcare drawbacks such as costs and capital can potentially be mitigated by share - based approaches, from group consultations to telemedicine.

Technology has propelled the sharing economy to its current state, and its momentum will increase with greater digital connectivity. While it has already made a mark in shipping, consumer goods, and services, many other traditional sectors will soon be affected by the sharing economy.
