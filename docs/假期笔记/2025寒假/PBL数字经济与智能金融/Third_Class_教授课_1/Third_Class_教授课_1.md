## IMPACT OF DIGITAL ECONOMY ON GDP GROWTH(WORLD BANK -END OF 2021)
![缺氧2.jpg](缺氧2.jpg){align="left" width="50%"}$\qquad$With the potential of digital technologies to expand access to markets and opportunities, helping countries invest in digital development is an important aspect of the World Bank's work to reduce poverty and inequality. The numbers speak for themselves: the digital economy is equivalent to 15.5% of global GDP, growing two and a half times faster than global GDP over the past 15 years. Research shows that a 10% increase in mobile broadband penetration in Africa would result in an increase of 2.5% of GDP per capita. In a post COVlD-19 environment, digitalization efforts will accelerate across the globe, but most developing countries do not currently possess the right tools and environment of that.

## Critical lmplications of Digital Economy
**I. Digital Economy's Macro - level Impact on Economic Development**![表情1.jpg](表情1.jpg){align="right" width="25%"}

 - From a macro view, the digital economy impacts economic development through production input and output efficiency. This is shown in increased factor input, better factor allocation efficiency, and higher total factor productivity due to technological progress and spillover.

**II. Impact on Developing Countries**

 - For developing countries, digitization is a key economic growth driver. It boosts capital and labor productivity, cuts transaction costs, and helps countries integrate into the global market system.

**III. Impact on Developed Countries**![表情2.jpg](表情2.jpg){align="left" width="25%"}

 - In developed countries, the digital economy's impact on economic development quality is mainly in promoting sustainable development and enhancing enterprise ability. For example, in the US from 2004 - 2012, it was a major economic growth driver, and the production sector's R & D investment and technological progress positively affected TFP growth.

**IV. Role of Informatization and Digital Policies**

 - Informatization is important for promoting TFP growth in 12 major OECD countries. Data from 2009 - 2018 in 15 advanced EU economies shows that national and industry digital policies can significantly promote economic growth.

## What's different today?
![缺氧3.jpg](缺氧3.jpg){align="left" width="45%"}$\qquad$When the pandemic arrived, many organizations scrambled to ensure the health and safety of their employees while simultaneously building infrastructure to support remote work. Ad hoc fixes ruled the day as companies patched together solutions to preserve business continuity.

$\qquad$Much of that is over now——and in the case of digital transformation efforts, it also served as a catalyst for change. Where do we see proof that the pandemic fast-tracked digital transformation? Respondents to Celerity and Ranstadt US survey were crystal clear on that.
